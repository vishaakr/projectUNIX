# projectUNIX

Hi, this is my bonus assignment for CS  2043.
I created a rock paper scissor game using the stuff I learned in class.
It takes in input from the user and uses a txt file for the scoreboard.
I used if statements, a case statement, a while loop. 
I created a public repository in github. My username is vishaaak and my repository is called projectUNIX. I believe it is public.  
To download it, take the url and use git clone <URL>
Then run the file rps.sh. 
I hope you enjoy it.
